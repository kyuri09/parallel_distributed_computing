compile: 
	1. make
	2. execution file : sequential / parallel


how to run

sequential:
	./sequential [mode] [input image path] [output image path]
	
	mode : flip / grayscale / smooth
	ex) ./sequential grayscale images/discos.ppm discos_gray.ppm
		./sequential flip images/kim.ppm kim_flip.ppm

parallel:
	sh execution.sh [mode] [node number] [input image path] [output image path]

	mode : flip / grayscale/ smooth
	ex) sh execution.sh flip 4 images/discos.ppm discos_parallel_flip.ppm
		sh execution.sh smooth 8 images/kim.ppm kim_parallel_smooth.ppm
